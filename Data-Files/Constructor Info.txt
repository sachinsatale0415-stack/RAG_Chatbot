constructor
	It is a special member function .
Special because

a) it is used to initialize (construct) the instance member/s.
b) it has got the same name as of class
c) it does not have a return type.

There are 2 types of constructor

1) default or no-arg constructor

	constructor having no arguments.
	if no constructor is defined in the class, compiler by default provides "no-arg constructor". But the moment we define some constructor in the class, compiler does not provide "default or no-arg constructor".

2) parameterized constructor
	constructor with at least one argument.


In which case no-arg constructor is required
	MyClass m1=new MyClass();

	new MyClass();

In which case parameterized constructor is required
	MyClass m1=new MyClass(20);

	MyClass m2=new MyClass(40);

what happens when object is created.

a) memory is allocated for instance member/s.
b) constructor is called
