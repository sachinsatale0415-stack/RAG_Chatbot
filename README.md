# 🚀 LLM-Powered Multimodal RAG Chatbot

An intelligent **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot** that answers user queries by retrieving relevant information from documents and generating responses strictly grounded in the retrieved context — minimizing hallucinations and improving answer accuracy.

👨‍💻 **Developed by:** Sachin Satale  

🎓 **Guided by:** Prof. Veena Sarda  

## 🌟 Overview

This project implements a Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that enhances LLM responses with external knowledge retrieval.

Instead of relying only on the model’s memory, the chatbot:

1. Extracts knowledge from documents (PDF, TXT, Images)

2. Converts them into embeddings

3. Stores them in a vector database

4. Retrieves relevant chunks during queries

5. Generates grounded answers using an LLM
